                  <p>Solar energy has been recognized as the most promising source of renewable energy all over the world and now it has been the main source of energy rather than a compromise. Solar energy keeps the potential to replace the century old energy harnessing technology which highly carbon intensive. As per the recent IEA declaration renewable is not a niche fuel any more it has been now mainstream. Solar and wind is surpassing the other renewable to be the largest share in renewable market. The drastic downfall (around 10% annually) in the cost of solar modules has accelerated the growth and led the energy enthusiasts all over the world to think of it. The world now is taking more in terms of carbon and efficiency because of global environment concerns which is also a big threat to the humanity.</p>

<p>India&rsquo;s position in the region between tropic of Cancer and tropic of Capricorn attracts more solar energy because this region is ideal for facilitating solar energy. With aim to create a collaborative platform for increased deployment of solar energy technologies and improve access to energy, India has put foundation stone for the formation of international Solar Alliance (ISA). Around 120 countries have already been agreed on it and more are interested to be the part of it. India being headquarters of ISA, the country has a better prospect for the development of solar energy in years to come. India is densely populated country and this would be big concern for solar energy development as land has been a big challenge, solar PV plant as of now requires 4.5 to 5 acers of land for 1 MW which is comparatively high. The other options available in terms of rooftop solar which is also finding difficulty because of demand side concerns.</p>

<p>Indian government has targeted 100 GW of solar PV by 2022 of which 60 GW is ground-mounted solar and 40 GW is rooftop solar. India&rsquo;s strong commitment in COP 21 in Paris last year has also been a game changer for not only Indian solar market but also the global one. India&rsquo;s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) prior to Paris conference talked too much about the renewable energy.</p>

<p>PV is rapidly emerging as the king of Indian renewables. The sector has seen an impressive 59% CAGR in the last four fiscal years to reach 10GW installed capacity at the end of November 2016. While it still represents only 2% of grid-tied generation capacity, it is growing twice as fast as wind and coal. Driven by federal and state-level auctions, solar power is also being installed in almost all states across the country, unlike wind power which is focused in the south-west of the country. The more distributed nature of solar helps alleviate transmission bottlenecks and brings generation closer to the point of consumption. This ease of solar energy given the liberty of behind the meter generation giving more power in the hands of consumer, the evolution of net metering is the contribution of solar energy only. The dynamic growth of solar energy around the world and how India has not kept from the global flow can be seen from the following figure. Seeing the growth in capacity additions in the last three years (744MW- 2014, 1,781MW in 2015, 4,156MW in Nov-2016) the big target and will to achieve that target is clear, government is more focused at the ground work.</p>

                <p>Feed-in Tariffs (FiT) have proved to be the most effective policy driver for the growth and development of the photovoltaic sector.&nbsp; The FiT model has been optimized and successfully implemented in Germany, and as a result it has emerged as the largest market for photovoltaics in spite of a relatively low solar radiation.&nbsp; Today, over 40 countries have adopted the FiT model.</p>

<p>Appropriate FiTs ensure an attractive return for solar project investors.&nbsp; As FiTs are generation-based incentives, many governments are more comfortable with such an arrangement compared to upfront capital subsidies.&nbsp; Further, FiT arrangements are convenient to administer from a technological as well as an accountability standpoint.</p>

                <p>The cost of photovoltaic systems is steadily decreasing.  The cost trends are very well understood, and are a function of scale of the industry as well as time period.  It is expected that most of the parts of the world will achieve grid parity by 2020, while certain regions of the world have already attained grid parity. Grid parity is a phenomenon where the cost of solar power becomes equivalent to the cost of conventionally generated power.  India is expected to reach grid parity around 2017-18.  It is after grid parity that the solar industry is expected to aggressively penetrate the market.  The acceleration towards grid parity in order to expedite mainstream penetration of solar technology into the energy sector drives many governments to incentivize and deploy at an early stage. Solar power has already achieved grid parity in a few states like commercial customers of Delhi, Gujarat, Mumbai, etc.</p>

                <p>Certain solar markets are driven by capital or equivalent subsidies making the project viable.  For example, many State Governments along with the Federal Government in the United States of America offer investment tax credits and property tax incentives upon installation of photovoltaic systems.  Capital subsidies enable the project developer to trade solar energy at a lower cost, which is more agreeable to the utilities compared to the high FiTs.  In India, the MNRE also provides capital subsidies, as in case of this project under JNNSM Phase II Batch I in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF).</p>

            <div class="normaltext">
                <p>In addition to the general RPO mandated on utilities, particularly Distribution Companies (DISCOMs), many national and state governments around the world have also started specifying the solar-specific RPO, often known as the &lsquo;solar carve-out&rsquo;.&nbsp; However, the success in such cases lies in the implementation of such obligations, which is usually in the form of enforcement.</p>

<p>Many states in India, through their respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, have also defined their RPOs. As per the current scenario, electricity utilities of only seven to eight states have been able to meet their RPO targets. Other states fail to attain their RPO targets due to lack of uniformity in providing longer trajectory for the RPO targets. With the new RPO targets to be announced there can be a positive impact on pricing and tariff for electricity of solar and other renewable energy resources.&nbsp; A summary of these RPOs is given in Annexure 1: Solar-Renewable Purchase Obligation in States of India</p>

<p>Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)</p>

<p>REC is a mechanism to facilitate the compliance of RPO&rsquo;s across the states of the country and provides an option to obligated entities to fulfill their targets by purchasing RECs that are traded on the exchanges like India Energy Exchange (IEX) and Power Exchange India (PXIL). But mechanism could not take a big flight due to insufficient buyers and excess sellers. At present the prices of REC have crashed down to INR 3,500 (Floor price) and INR 5,800 (Forbearance price).</p>

                <p>Other drivers that signify the advantages of solar power and may have tangible benefits in one form or another, include:</p>
<p><strong>Infinite fuel source</strong><strong>:</strong> The earth receives 6,000 times greater solar energy than the global requirement today.&nbsp; The practically infinite fuel source is one of the key advantages and promise of solar technology.</p>

<p><strong>Emission reduction</strong><strong>: </strong>Solar energy technologies practically do not emit greenhouse gases, thus helping the global targets of such emission reductions.&nbsp; Additionally, typical photovoltaic systems are not involved in any combustion, radioactivity, high temperature/ pressure processes or disposal issues.</p>

<p><strong>Point of use</strong><strong>:</strong> Photovoltaic and smaller solar thermal systems can be installed at the point of use, whether in a grid-connected mode or a stand-alone mode.&nbsp; This feature helps users to be self-sufficient in terms of energy, while reducing and transmission losses.</p>

<p><strong>Low maintenance</strong><strong>:</strong> Typical photovoltaic systems are stationary at a fixed orientation.&nbsp; There are no moving parts involved, except in case of certain tracking systems.&nbsp; The major maintenance activity for a photovoltaic system is cleaning the dust off the photovoltaic modules, which is a very simple activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>High reliability and predictability</strong><strong>:</strong> The industry standard warranty for photovoltaic modules is for 25 years, which indicate its highly reliable nature.&nbsp; The balance of systems including inverters and transformers also has long respective guarantees.&nbsp; In addition, the output of solar energy systems can be predicted with a high level of confidence making it easy to integrate with energy sources in terms of dispatch ability.</p>

<p><strong>Modularity</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; Photovoltaic system can be tailored based on specific use, and due to the simplicity of connecting wires, newer capacities can easily be added if required.</p>

                <p>Indian economy, therefore, desperately needs a better functioning of the power sector that can meet the market&rsquo;s demand for quality power at a globally competitive rate. The current infrastructure would need the availability of assured and quality power at affordable price through reliable and adequate generation, transmission and distribution facilities.</p>

<p>Now, with the rise in awareness with regards to environmental protection and conservation, the future growth in energy sector must consider the adoption of renewable energy sources, in order to develop in an environmentally benign manner. The key issues having energy-related implications faced by a developing country like India are, rising population, need for economic growth, access to adequate commercial energy supplies and the financial resources needed to achieve it, rational energy pricing regime, improvements in energy efficiency of both the energy supply and consumption, technological upgradation, energy security a matching R&amp;D base and environmental protection.</p>

<p>However, development of renewable energy (RE) capacity &nbsp;remains limited to a few states like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka,that can be attributed to having a favourable policy and framework implemented by respective state governments or by Government of India, and also &nbsp;due to favourable climatic conditions. Given the importance of ensuring energy security and the focus on clean energy, the share of RE sources in the future is likely to only increase. &nbsp;The total installed capacity of solar has recently crossed 10 GW mark.</p>

                <p>In a scenario, when new discoveries in energy sector are waiting to be commercially exploited by industrial sector and when India is forging ahead towards a renewable energy (RE) based economy, Gujarat is taking the leading in renewable energy and primarily in solar.</p>

<p>Gujarat leads the country in the per capita consumption of electricity. Going forward, Gujarat is planning huge investments to accelerate stronger economic momentum. The projected industrialization levels with increase in urbanization and standard of living which would lead to substantially higher demand for power. The energy units required in the next decade would be nearly two and half times the existing generation. Gujarat also has a large untapped potential for renewable energy basically solar energy which needs proper and efficient exploitation.</p>

<p>Gujarat&rsquo;s performance on power front has been the best as it has been able to achieve zero per cent normal power deficit and nil peak power deficits in several years because of good grid management. As of November 2016, Gujarat had a total installed power generation capacity of 30,324.56 MW.</p>

<p>In a recent report of the 40 state-owned power distribution companies (Discoms) that the Mistry of Power, Government of India, audited for annual financial and operational performance, the four Discoms of Gujarat have topped the list, for the fourth year in a row.As per the report, no other Discoms in the country have got an A+ rating except the four Discoms of Gujarat.</p>

                <p>Government of Gujar in in 2015 notified the solar policy with an objective to increase generation of green energy. It is aimed at promoting several modes of generation, including roof-top solar power for house/building owners, distribution of solar-powered pumps to farmers and standalone photo-voltaic (PV) systems for domestic use.</p>

<p>The state will facilitate de-centralised and off-grid solar applications to meet various energy requirements for domestic purpose, according to an official release.</p>

<p>For those living in remote areas, where regular grid-based connection is not feasible, the Government will initiate schemes for basic home lighting using PV system. The salient features of the Solar Policy for captive and rooftop solar PV system are listed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For distributed generation promotion through net metering mechanism, the solar photovoltaic installation size has been capped at 50% of the sanctioned load of the power consumer.</li>
  <li>Any excess power generated by a rooftop PV system will be bought by the distribution company at Average Pooled Power Cost (APPC).</li>
  <li>Banking of excess energy will be allowed for one billing cycle.</li>
  <li>Transmission charges and losses, wheeling charges and losses and demand cut are not applicable on energy generated by rooftop solar PV systems.</li>
  <li>For electricity generated by rooftop solar PV systems in Gujarat, no electricity duty will be applicable. The generated solar power is also exempt from Cross subsidy surcharge and additional surcharge.</li>

                <p>PV is progressively becoming more attractive, vis-a-vis other renewable sources of power, as its cost declines. The various factors leading to decline in cost includes setting up of large scale plants, integration across the value chain, declining cost of raw material, reducing material consumption and higher efficiency of modules.</p>

<p>Due to its proximity to the equator, India receives abundant sunlight throughout the year. Solar PV solution has the potential to transform the lives of 450 million people, who rely on highly subsidized kerosene oil and other fuels, primarily to light up their homes. Renewable energy source is a practical solution to address the persistent demand supply gap in the power industry.</p>

<p>The following features of solar power make it the most viable renewable source of energy for India:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solar energy is available in abundance</li>
  <li>Available across the country &ndash; unlike other renewable sources, which have geographical limitations</li>
  <li>Available throughout the year</li>
  <li>Decentralized / off-grid applications &ndash; addressing rural electrification issues</li>
  <li>Modularity and scalability</li>

<p class="titlesection">Merits of the Solar PV Plant:</p>

<ol class="lowerroman">
  <li>Power from the sun is clean, silent, abundant and free.</li>
  <li>Photovoltaic process releases no CO2, SO2 or NO2 gases during energy generation, which are normally associated with burning finite fossil fuel reserves and don&rsquo;t contribute to global warming.</li>
  <li>Photovoltaics are now a proven technology which is inherently safe as opposed to other fossil fuel based electricity generating technologies.</li>
  <li>No fuel is required for generation, so fuel cost of power generation is zero</li>
  <li>Solar power shall augment the needs of peak power needs</li>
  <li>Solar Powered Grid Connect Plants can act as tail end energizers, which in turn reduces the transmission and distribution losses.</li>
  <li>Solar Power can be set up on barren / unproductive land with reasonable sun radiations. Solar PV plant&nbsp; do not require large Water source or effluent disposal system as required in the case of conventional thermal plants.</li>
  <li>Generation of electricity from Solar PV is totally free of Green House Gas emission.</li>
  <li>Routine O&amp;M cost is comparatively very less.</li>
  <li>Man power Requirement is very less.</li>
</ol>
<div class="page-break"></div>
<p class="titlesection">Demerits of Solar PV Power Plant:</p>

<ol class="lowerroman">
  <li>Initial capital cost is very high compared to any other conventional technology.</li>
  <li>Low capacity utilization factor typically in the range of 16 to 20 %.</li>
  <li>Large area of land required.</li>

                <p>In conclusion, the global solar market is exponentially increasing at a rate of 40% per annum, which is based on various national and state-level initiatives scattered around the world.&nbsp; Such high growth rates are a characteristic of a developing market before reaching a steady growth rate.&nbsp; The deployment of solar technologies is mainly contingent on policies, where the main drivers are generation-based or capital subsidies as well as renewable purchase obligations. The REC mechanism is a novel but promising mechanism in India in its juvenile stages, but has proved to be successful around the world to meet renewable purchase obligations. At the present scenario MNRE/SECI has proposed capital based subsidy under various schemes from their Clean Energy Fund in order to reduce the cost of electricity per unit to the utilities. In addition, several state governments like Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, MP, Telangana, AP, TN&nbsp; and others are also venturing into solar with innovative business models to optimize the cost of solar PV plant. The rooftop solar power plants are promoted across the country for the self-consumption of the customers. Hence, the favourable policy and the reduction in the cost of equipment are the one of the major drivers.</p>

                <p>Power quality is often defined as the electrical network’s or the grid’s ability to supply a clean and stable power supply. Power quality ideally creates a perfect power supply that is always available, has a pure noise-free sinusoidal wave shape, and is always within the voltage and frequency tolerances defined for the electrical grid. In simplest words, it determines the fitness of electric power to consumer devices.</p>

                <p>A good emergency back-up makes your home or work place blackout proof but it comes with an additional cost. The cost of back-up power is much higher than the grid-based power. So, solar power provides you a flexibility to reduce the extra burden of the back-up power at a cheaper rate. In addition, distributed nature of solar units are convenient when you need electricity at the source of demand itself.Here at IRS, ONGC battery back facility is not required.</p>

                <p>Site selection of a project for installation of solar PV power plant is one of the most important initial steps. Electricity generation costs and techno-economic feasibility of the project both are highly dependent on the project site itself. A good site has to have a high annual solar radiation to obtain maximum solar electricity output. It must be reasonably shadow free to accommodate the solar PV modules. It should also be close to the electricityinterconnection pointof the building to avoid the need to build expensive electricity lines for evacuating the power. Accessibility to site and rooftopshall be easy.</p>

                <p>Chandkheda is a neighbourhood in the Northwest of the metropolitan city of Ahmedabad in India. It lies west to Sabarmati River, and is in northern portion of Ahmedabad.Chandkheda has developed into a commendable residential area mostly because of the ONGC office situated nearby. Most of the officers choose to stay in this suburb of Ahmedabad rather than in the busy city itself. The ONGC colony is well developed and has a club, a Kendriya Vidyalaya School, a dispensary and a stadium in addition to other facilities. There are many housing societies in the area and the newly developed CG Road (Chandkheda-Gandhinagar) road is a very posh residential area.</p>

                <p>Ideally, actual measurement of solar radiation at the site is desirable for estimating the projected power output since solar energy is the raw material for power generation. It may be noted that the annual average solar radiation measurement even for 1-2 years is not sufficient. World over, an average radiation value for at least 8-10 years is used for solar power project designing since climatic variations are quite wide year-to-year. Under such a situation, the prevailing practice world over is to develop software which uses satellite measured solar radiation and matches it with the actual ground measured data for the particular site where actual data has been obtained for many years. Thus, a co-relation between satellite data and actually measured ground data is developed through the software, which helps in deriving the radiation values for unknown sites where actual ground measured data are not available. In the present study, radiation data published by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India is used.</p>

<p>For the PV solar applications the cell absorbs both direct and diffused sunlight hence, GHI is an important parameter, which is the measurement of total solar radiation including direct and diffused radiation on horizontal surfaces usually measured using Pyranometer. However, the solar PV modules in power projects are typically placed at the latitude angle from the ground surface for getting optimum power generation. Therefore, Global Irradiance on Tilted surface (GTI) becomes more relevant. The derived values are tabulated below in Table 4-3.</p>

                <p>The IRS, ONGC has a potential for 301 kW solar PV System. This capacity on its rooftop is determined considering the rooftop area, electrical load demand at the building and relevant state Regulation. The power cut at the site is nil and even the quality of power is also good.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The total roof area space available on the IRS, ONGC; Ahmedabad is 5,254 sq. m but due to existing nearby structures on the roof and trees, the entire space can&rsquo;t be utilized for installation of Rooftop Solar PV System (RSPVS). Hence, a calculation is made to determine the total shadow free available area. As shown in below, parts of the roof shall be used to install RSPVS. The total available shadow free roof area is 3,017 sq. m. Hence, 74% of available rooftop space is completely shadow free.</p>

                <p>India being in the northern hemisphere the solar panel is to be installed facing south to maximize electricity generation. This placement allows panels to take full advantage of the sun’s path in the sky as the sun shines longest on a building’s south side. However, southeast- and southwest-facing panels will perform about 5 percent less efficiently.</p>

            <div class="normaltext">   
                <p>Further, Photovoltaic panels are very sensitive to shading. Any shading will dramatically reduce electricity generation. Installers use a Solar Pathfinder device to determine if there are shading concerns from trees (consider mature height), chimneys, nearby buildings, etc. Keep in mind the sun’s path changes throughout the year. For maximum electricity production, it is ensured the solar panels will be unshaded year-round (especially from 9 or 10 am until 3 pm).</p>

            <div class="normaltext">   
                <p>Typically panels are mount directly (flush) on an existing south-facing roof for aesthetics. To maximize electricity generated year-round, mount modules at an angle equal to or close to your site’s latitude (28 degrees for Delhi; 12 degrees for Bangalore). Installers can tilt at an angle best for your site, system type, and electricity needs.

            <div class="normaltext">   
                <p>Most roofs can safely support PV panels and mounting system weight. The rule of thumb is 2 to 5 pounds per square foot depending on the panel type and installation method. For example, a 320 watt crystalline panel (1.9m x 0.9 feet) weighs about 22.5 kg. An installer should determine if the roof/structure can handle the added weight. Innovative mounting systems can make panel removal easy, but because panels can last 25+ years, it may be less expensive and labor intensive to make needed roof repairs before installing panels.</p>
                <p>If your building fulfils the above-mentioned points or you can make adjustments wherever required, then your building or site is a good solar electric system candidate! A more detailed assessment of your roof is discussed further in the report. </p>

<p>For the proposedsolar PV power plant at IRS-ONGC, poly-crystalline silicon modules of 320 Wp have been considered for designing purpose. This enables optimum sizing in terms of power conditioners and power evacuation system. The selected PV module should have RF identification tag (RFID) as well as label for tracking purpose. The schematic of typical grid-connected solar PV system is given in Figure and specifications of a PV module are given below in Figure 6-5.

As the PV array output varies with the solar radiation the inverter has to cope with the same.

For this project, multiple inverters for each building of suitable kW capacity PCUs is recommended. Other configurations are also possible based on the final design. The system exports power to the grid when the DC output from solar array is available. The 3 phase output voltages and current are sinusoidal with low total harmonic distortion.

                <p>Annual Energy Yield for the proposed PV power plant is defined as the amount ofenergy fed into the grid after due consideration of all kinds of generation and distributionlosses. The solar PV based power plant comprises optical energy input (which isessentially dependent on the geographical/seasonal/ climatic and operating parameterswith time) and electrical output (which depends on the technical specifications ofelectrical appliances in use).</p>
                <p>The financial viability of a RSPVS depends greatly upon the most important parameter, namely reliable annual average solar radiation data for a given site averaged over several years. Solar radiation, which is the energy input, is very sensitive to local weather conditions and prone to supply fluctuations, directly affecting the output, project feasibility, techno-economic viability and performance of the project. It is the primary task of the solar system developer, investor, designer or an analyst to determine the amount, quality and duration of solar energy available at a specific site before selecting it for a solar PV power project. Although solar irradiance is relatively constant outside the earth's atmosphere, local climate influences can cause wide variations in available irradiance on the earth’s surface from site to site. In addition, the relative motion of the sun with respect to the earth will allow surfaces with different orientations to intercept different amounts of solar energy at different locations.</p>
                
                <p>Power generations in term of kWh for the proposed site at <Project Name>at <Location> are calculated by using AHA! Proand PVsyst software. A standard radiation data from MNRE is considered for energy generation estimation. Detailed analysis of design parameters and resultant output along with stage-wise losses are carried out using PVsyst software which is attached in the Annexure.</p>

            <div class="normaltext">   
                <p class="yellowcolor">Module Mismatch Losses</p>
                <p>The maximum power output of the total PV array is always less than the sum of the maximum output of the individual modules. This difference is a result of slight inconsistencies in performance from one module to the next and is called module mismatch. Maximum 3-4% losses will be there for module mismatch, but the modules shall be connected in series and parallel of similar properties to reduce such losses and it will reduce the mismatch losses to 1%.</p><br/>
                
                
                <p class="yellowcolor">Cable Losses</p>
                <p>Power is also lost to resistance in the system wiring. These losses should be kept to a minimum below 1% for the system. It is recommended to keep total energy loss in the cables be around 1.0%.</p><br/>
                
                
                <p class="yellowcolor">DC to AC Conversion Losses</p>
                <p>The DC power generated by the solar module must be converted AC power using an inverter. Some power is lost in the conversion process. In this case as discussed before that selected inverter has maximum DC power into AC power conversion efficiency of 98%.</p><br/>
                
                
                <p class="yellowcolor">Transformer Losses</p>
                <p>To account for different losses in the transformers like core and ohmic losses a typical coefficient of 0.989 has been considered i.e. 1.1%.</p><br/>
                
                
                <p class="yellowcolor">Temperature Losses</p>
                <p>Whenever there is increase in ambient temperature, the temperature of the PV module also increases, resulting in reduction of power output from the PV module. This depends on the temperature coefficient of the PV module as specified by the manufacturer. A loss of 10.1% will be there with increment in ambient temperature at the project site from standard conditions.</p><br/>
                
                
                <p class="yellowcolor">Shading Losses</p>
                <p>Shading on the solar PV panel can bring gigantic malicious effect on the energy yield. Generally, the potential solar PV shading objects are tree, nearby building buildings. Rooftop solar PV installations are more prone to the shading losses. As far as the large scale solar PV installation is concerned, shading of inverter room, control room and inter-row are the potential reason of shading losses. Moreover, these objects provide shading in the early morning hours or late evening hours. However, while designing the solar PV plant, all these factors are always taken under serious consideration and shading losses are optimized as 1.5%.</p><br/>
                
                
                <p class="yellowcolor">Annual Degradation</p>
                <p>The estimated life of solar PV modules is considered as 25 years. Performance of solar PV modules degrades over its specified lifetime. Normally, PV module manufacturers provide a performance guarantee and indicate the rate of degradation over the module lifetime. Essentially the solar PV modules used in grid solar power plants are warranted for output wattage which should not be less than 90% at the end of 10 years and 80% at the end of 25 years. In the present analysis, the annual degradation in production has been taken conservatively taken as 0.83 %, linear for entire project life of 25 years.</p>

Once the go ahead is given by the Discom, rooftop PV systemshall be connected to near the grid. In case of net-metering based system, the existing energy meter shall be replaced with the Net-Meter which can account import and export of power from the building premises and in case of gross-metering based system, a new energy meter shall be installed after the existing energy meter i.e. towards the grid side.</p>

                <p>As per the findings of the survey, the minimum capacity that can be installed at the IRS, ONGC is 300 kW but if the trees at few places can be trimmed then the installed capacity can be increased. The major impact of shading is on Block B &ndash; Main Building, almost 70% of the roof is utilized due to shadow of trees falling on the south side of the roof and Canteen Terrace building have unutilized area of 51%. Apart from this, all other buildings are efficiently being utilized for rooftop solar PV system.</p>

<p>The estimated electricity generation from the proposed RSPVS will be around 449 MWh per year.</p>

<p>An approximate cost of the RSPVS will be around Rs.,1,95,00,000/- to Rs. 2,10,00,000/- with a payback of 5.53 years without subsidy.</p>
